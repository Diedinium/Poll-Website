                                        The Conservative Party, officially the Conservative and Unionist Party, is a
                                        centre-right political party in the United Kingdom. It is currently the
                                        governing party,
                                        having been so since the 2010 general election, where a coalition government
                                        with the Liberal Democrats was formed. In 2015, the Conservatives led by David
                                        Cameron won a
                                        surprise majority and formed the first majority Conservative government since
                                        1992. However, the snap election on 8 June 2017 resulted in a hung parliament,
                                        and the
                                        party lost its parliamentary majority. It is reliant on the support of a
                                        Northern Irish political party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), in order to
                                        command a
                                        majority in the House of Commons through a confidence-and-supply deal. The party
                                        leader, Theresa May, has served as both Leader of the Conservative Party and
                                        Prime
                                        Minister since July 2016. It is the largest party in local government with 9,008
                                        councillors. The Conservative Party is one of the two major contemporary
                                        political
                                        parties in the United Kingdom, the other being its modern rival, the Labour
                                        Party.

                                        The Conservative Party was founded in 1834 from the Tory Party—giving rise to
                                        the Conservatives' colloquial name of Tories—and was one of two dominant
                                        political parties
                                        in the nineteenth century, along with the Liberal Party. In the 1890s, it formed
                                        a coalition government with the Liberal Unionist Party, a break-away faction of
                                        the
                                        Liberal Party, and in 1912 the two merged to form the Conservative and Unionist
                                        Party. In the 1920s, the Liberal vote greatly diminished and the Labour Party
                                        became
                                        the Conservatives' main rivals. Conservative Prime Ministers led governments for
                                        57 years of the twentieth century, including Winston Churchill (1940–1945,
                                        1951–1955)
                                        and Margaret Thatcher (1979–1990). Thatcher's tenure led to wide-ranging
                                        economic liberalisation. The Conservative Party's domination of British politics
                                        throughout
                                        the twentieth century has led to them being referred to as one of the most
                                        successful political parties in the Western world.
                                    </p>

                                        On 11 July 2016, Theresa May became the leader of the Conservative Party with
                                        immediate effect following the withdrawal from the leadership election of her
                                        sole
                                        remaining opponent, Andrea Leadsom. She was appointed Prime Minister of the
                                        United Kingdom on 13 July 2016. She has promised social reform and a more
                                        centrist political
                                        outlook for the Conservative Party and its government. In a speech after her
                                        appointment, May emphasised the term Unionist in the name of the party,
                                        reminding all of
                                        "the precious, precious bond between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern
                                        Ireland". May considers herself a one nation conservative.

                                        The Labour Party is a centre-left political party in the United Kingdom which
                                        has been described as an alliance of social democrats, democratic socialists and
                                        trade
                                        unionists. The party's platform emphasises greater state intervention, social
                                        justice and strengthening workers' rights. Labour is a full member of the Party
                                        of
                                        European Socialists and Progressive Alliance, and holds observer status in the
                                        Socialist International. As of 2017, the party was considered the "largest party
                                        in
                                        Western Europe" in terms of party membership, with more than half a million
                                        members.

                                        The Labour Party was founded in 1900, having grown out of the trade union
                                        movement and socialist parties of the nineteenth century. It overtook the
                                        Liberal Party to
                                        become the main opposition to the Conservative Party in the early 1920s, forming
                                        minority governments under Ramsay MacDonald in 1924 and from 1929 to 1931.
                                        Labour
                                        later served in the wartime coalition from 1940 to 1945, after which it formed a
                                        majority government under Clement Attlee until 1951. Labour was next in
                                        government
                                        from 1964 to 1970 under Harold Wilson and from 1974 to 1979, first under Wilson
                                        and then under James Callaghan.

                                        The Labour Party was most recently in government from 1997 to 2010 under Tony
                                        Blair and Gordon Brown during the "New Labour" era, first elected with a
                                        landslide majority
                                        of 179, reduced to 66 in the 2005 election. Since leaving government, the party
                                        has been led by Ed Miliband from 2010 and Jeremy Corbyn from 2015.

                                        Labour is currently the Official Opposition in the Parliament of the United
                                        Kingdom, having won the second-largest number of seats in the 2017 general
                                        election.
                                        The Labour Party is currently the largest party in the Welsh Assembly, forming
                                        the main party in the current Welsh government. The party is the third largest
                                        in the
                                        Scottish Parliament and sends the most MEPs from the United Kingdom to the
                                        European Parliament, sitting in the Socialists and Democrats Group. Whilst the
                                        party organises
                                        in Northern Ireland, it does not contest elections there, instead supporting the
                                        Social Democratic and Labour Party.

                                        The Liberal Democrats (often referred to as the Lib Dems) are a liberal British
                                        political party formed in 1988 from a merger of the Liberal Party and the Social
                                        Democratic Party (SDP), a splinter group from the Labour Party which had formed
                                        the SDP–Liberal Alliance from 1981.

                                        At the 2010 general election, the Lib Dems led by Nick Clegg won 57 seats,
                                        making them the third-largest party in the House of Commons behind the
                                        Conservatives
                                        with 306 and Labour with 258. With no party having an overall majority, the
                                        party formed a coalition government with the Conservatives, with Clegg becoming
                                        Deputy Prime Minister and others taking up ministerial positions.

                                        At the 2015 general election, the Liberal Democrats were reduced to eight MPs
                                        and became the fourth largest party in the House of Commons, behind the SNP
                                        leading to
                                        Nick Clegg's resignation. At the 2017 general election, the party returned
                                        twelve MPs, becoming the third-largest UK-wide party in terms of votes cast.
                                        Sir Vince Cable succeeded Tim Farron as party leader.

                                        The ideology of the Liberal Democrats draws from liberal ideas. The party is in
                                        favour of reform of traditional British institutions such as the Church of
                                        England,
                                        a change in the electoral system from first-past-the-post to proportional
                                        representation, and drug decriminalisation. The Liberal Democrats supported the
                                        adoption
                                        of the Euro and greater European integration. In recent years the adoption of
                                        the Euro hasn't been on their agenda, with no mention of it in their
                                        2017 manifesto.

                                        The UK Independence Party (UKIP) is a hard Eurosceptic, right-wing to far-right
                                        political party in the United Kingdom.
                                        It currently has one representative in the House of Lords and seven Members of
                                        the European Parliament (MEPs). It has four Assembly Members (AMs) in the
                                        National
                                        Assembly for Wales and one member in the London Assembly.

                                        UKIP originated as the Anti-Federalist League, a single-issue Eurosceptic party
                                        established in London by the historian Alan Sked in 1991. It was renamed UKIP in
                                        1993
                                        but its growth remained slow. It was largely eclipsed by the Eurosceptic
                                        Referendum Party until the latter's 1997 dissolution. In 1997, Sked was ousted
                                        by a faction led
                                        by Nigel Farage, who became the party's preeminent figure. In 2006, Farage
                                        officially became leader and under his direction the party adopted a wider
                                        policy platform
                                        and capitalised on concerns about rising immigration, in particular among the
                                        White British working class. This resulted in significant breakthroughs at the
                                        2013 local
                                        elections, 2014 European elections, and 2015 general election. The pressure UKIP
                                        exerted on the government was the main reason for the 2016 referendum which led
                                        to the
                                        decision for the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union. Farage then
                                        stepped down as UKIP leader, and the party's vote share and membership heavily
                                        declined.
                                        Following repeat leadership crises, Gerard Batten took over; UKIP was then
                                        widely described as moving into far-right territory, at which point many
                                        longstanding members–including

                                        Ideologically positioned on the right-wing of British politics, UKIP is
                                        characterised by political scientists as part of a broader European radical
                                        right. UKIP's primary emphasis
                                        has been on Euroscepticism, calling for the United Kingdom's exit from the
                                        European Union (EU). It promotes a British unionist and British nationalist
                                        agenda, encouraging a unitary
                                        British identity in opposition to growing Welsh and Scottish nationalisms.
                                        Political scientists have argued that in doing so, it conflates Britishness with
                                        Englishness and appeals to
                                        English nationalist sentiment. UKIP has also placed emphasis on lowering
                                        immigration, rejecting multiculturalism, and opposing what it calls the
                                        "Islamification" of Britain. Influenced
                                        by Thatcherism and classical liberalism, it describes itself as economically
                                        libertarian and promotes liberal economic policies. On social issues like LGBT
                                        rights, education policy, and
                                        criminal justice it is conservative. Having an ideological heritage stemming
                                        from the right-wing of the Conservative Party, it distinguishes itself from the
                                        mainstream political establishment
                                        through heavy use of populist rhetoric, including describing its supporters as
                                        the "People's Army".
                                    </p>

                                        Governed by its leader and National Executive Committee, UKIP is divided into
                                        twelve regional groups. A founding member of the Alliance for Direct Democracy

                                        most of UKIP's MEPs sit with the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group in
                                        the European Parliament. While gaining electoral support from various sectors of
                                        British society, psephologists
                                        have established that its primary voting base is in England and consists largely
                                        of older, working-class white Britons. UKIP has faced a critical reception from
                                        mainstream political parties,
                                        much of the media, and anti-fascist groups.

                                        The Green Party of England and Wales is a green, left-wing political party in
                                        England and Wales. Headquartered in London, since September 2018, its Co-Leaders
                                        are Siân Berry and Jonathan Bartley.
                                        The Green Party has one Member of Parliament in the House of Commons, one
                                        representative in the House of Lords, and three Members of the European
                                        Parliament. It has various councillors in UK local government
                                        and two members of the London Assembly.

                                        The party's ideology combines environmentalism with left-wing economic policies,
                                        including well-funded, locally controlled public services within the confines of
                                        a steady state economy, and it supports proportional
                                        representation. It also takes a progressive approach to social policies such as
                                        civil liberties, animal rights, LGBT rights and drug policy reform. The party
                                        also believes strongly in nonviolence, basic income,
                                        a living wage, and democratic participation. The party comprises various
                                        regional divisions, including the semi-autonomous Wales Green Party.
                                        Internationally, the party is affiliated to the Global Greens and
                                        the European Green Party.

                                        The Green Party of England and Wales was established in 1990 alongside the
                                        Scottish Green Party and the Green Party in Northern Ireland through the
                                        division of the pre-existing Green Party, a group which had
                                        originally been established as the PEOPLE Party in 1973. Experiencing
                                        centralising reforms spearheaded by the Green 2000 group in the early 1990s, the
                                        party sought to emphasise growth in local governance,
                                        doing so throughout the 1990s. In 2010, the party gained its first MP in Lucas,
                                        who represents the constituency of Brighton Pavilion.

                                        The Scottish National Party (SNP) is a Scottish nationalist and
                                        social-democratic political party in Scotland.
                                        The SNP supports and campaigns for Scottish independence. It is the
                                        second-largest political party by membership in the United Kingdom, behind the
                                        Labour Party and ahead of the Conservative Party, is the
                                        third-largest by overall representation in the House of Commons, behind the
                                        Conservative Party and the Labour Party, and is the largest political party in
                                        Scotland, where it has the most seats in the Scottish
                                        Parliament and 35 out of the 59 Scottish seats in the House of Commons of the
                                        Parliament of the United Kingdom. The current Scottish National Party leader,
                                        Nicola Sturgeon, has served as First Minister of Scotland
                                        since November 2014.

                                        Founded in 1934 with the amalgamation of the National Party of Scotland and the
                                        Scottish Party, the party has had continuous parliamentary representation in
                                        Westminster since Winnie Ewing won the 1967 Hamilton by-election.
                                        With the establishment of the devolved Scottish Parliament in 1999, the SNP
                                        became the second-largest party, serving two terms as the opposition. The SNP
                                        gained power at the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, forming a minority
                                        government, before going on to win the 2011 Parliament election, after which it
                                        formed Holyrood's first majority government. It was reduced back to a minority
                                        government at the 2016 election.

                                        The SNP is the largest political party in Scotland in terms of both seats in the
                                        Westminster and Holyrood parliaments, and membership; reaching 125,482 members
                                        as of August 2018, 35 MPs and over 400 local councillors. The
                                        SNP also currently has 2 MEPs in the European Parliament, who sit in The
                                        Greens/European Free Alliance (Greens/EFA) group. The SNP is a member of the
                                        European Free Alliance (EFA). The party does not have any members of the
                                        House of Lords, as it has always maintained a position of objecting to an
                                        unelected upper house.
