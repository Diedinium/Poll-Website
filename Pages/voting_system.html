                                In the following outline the steps of a typical election are shown, to help simplify the voting process.

                                The first step for any election is that it is declared; this happens in a number of ways. The first is via the maximum term time before an election 
                                must be held, which is 5 years, or a "snap" election is held which can be called at any time, typically to take advantage of a unique circumstance or to
                                resolve a pressing issue.

                                date to remember; unless you are voting by mail, it is the only day you will be able to cast your ballot on.

                                Next a period of campaigning will follow from the parties vying for seats and power within the next government. This typically occurs in the form of 
                                election promises and an "election manifesto", we recommend taking a brief read on the highlights from the manifesto's that the parties put forward, as this 
                                is the best way to get an unfiltered look into what each party is promising. This campainging can take place up until a week before the election date.

                                On the day of voting polling stations will be opened up, there will typically be many different polling stations within a constituency, so you'll need to 
                                keep an eye on local news to find out which one is the nearest one to you. These polling stations are open from early in the morning to late at night, meaning there 
                                should be a chance for you to cast your vote regardless of what you are doing in the day. The process inside a polling station is to simply have your name ticked off as 
                                attending, and then to complete a ballot paper and put it in a ballot box.

                                When ballot stations start closing the results are then taken to a counting station, where ballots from across the constituency are also gathered up. The results 
                                are then tallied and once all votes are counted the constituency will report it's election result.

                                Throughout the night constituencies will announce their results, allowing media to build up a picture of the way the election is heading. Generally, once a certain number 
                                of constituencies have annoucned their results it becomes fairly clear which party will be able to form a government.

                                Once all the results are tallied, then the leading parties with the most number of constituencies (and therefore seats) will go on to form a government. They will either need to hold
                                complete control to do this (more than half the seats, 326) or form a coalition government as has been the case a few times in the past. From here it's up to you, the voter, to judge how 
                                well the party performs for the next election.

                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Within the UK, we use a system called First Past the Post, which you can read about in more detail on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting" target="blank">this wikipedia page about FPTP voting</a>. 
                                Esentially, with FPTP it is a "winner takes all" type of system, within each local constituency there can only be one winner, and the other votes that are cast end up not counting towards gaining 
                                their party any political power. This system means that elections are decided strongly by local effects, there are "safe" seats which are unlikely to change hands while other seats 
                                are hotly contested.
                            </p>

                                This has an unfortunate effect, in that votes from some constituencies matter more than others do, there is a lot of debate that surrounds the FPTP system and if it is really fair or 
                                holds up in modern times. Proponents for electoral reform have proposed systems such a "Single Transferable Vote", which you can read more about on the <a href="https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/voting-systems/types-of-voting-system/single-transferable-vote/" target="blank">electoral reform society website</a>

                                As interesting as electoral reform could be, this is not what this website is about. FPTP is the system that we have, and at least for now, needs to be worked with. The important thing is 
                                to be well informed on the issues in your constituency and to vote for candidates that represent your areas views the best, this is where the idea of tactial voting needs to be introduced. You can read 
                                more about what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_voting"></a>tactical voting is here</a>, but essentially it means that you sometimes vote for a party that may not be your best choice. 
                                For example, if Party A is your favourite but doesn't stand a chance of winning against your least favourite party in your area, Party B, but Party C does stand a decent chance then you could vote for Party C in 
                                order to prevent Party B winning in your area.

                                Due to the importance of constituencies to our elections, I'd recommend using this link
                                to <a href="https://beta.parliament.uk/find-your-constituency">find out what constituency you live in</a>. The graphic below givess a general overview in the way that constituencies are laid out in the UK, they are usually divided by population rather than county lines, 
                                in an effort to ensure a balance between the different areas. This results in dense population areas in cities having many more electoral zones, as can be seen on the map.

                                It is argued by many that in the grand scheme, your vote doesn't matter. This couldn't be further from the truth, due to the quirks of FPTP instead of your vote being one of 30 million, it is in fact 
                                one of 70,000. Due to your vote, and who you cast your ballot in favour of, mattering towards your local constituencies result your vote can be extremely powerful as local constituencies are often decided by 
                                a few hundred votes or less. You also need to think in terms of all the other voters who don't cast thier ballot, if all these people voted then it would cause hugely different results in some constituencies. In short; don't 
                                underestimate the power of your vote.
